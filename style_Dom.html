            <div><h2>A brief history of JavaScript</h2></div>
            <div id="message"> <p> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications.</p> 
                <p>It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self</p>
                <p>Netscape, for a time, made the best browser in the world and enjoyed market dominance.

                    In late 1995, when Microsoft cottoned-on to the competitive threat the Web posed, the Internet Explorer project was started in an all-out attempt to wrestle control of the emerging platform from Netscape.
                    
                    In so doing Microsoft became a mortal threat, compelling Netscape to respond. First, they started a standardization process to prevent Microsoft gaining control of the JavaScript language.</p> 
                    <p>Second, they partnered with Sun to leverage their shared interest in breaking the Microsoft monopoly.
                    
                        Sun began development of Java in 1990 in an attempt to write a language for “smart appliances”. This approach floundered and in 1994, Sun regrouped and set sights on the Web as the delivery platform of choice.</p>
